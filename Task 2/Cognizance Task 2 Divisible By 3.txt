solution:
1) # finding whether a number is divisible by 3 or not by not using "%"
operator
 get number i.e n
 assign s(primary sum)=0
 assign r = n
 while r>0
 i= r%10
 s=s+i
 r=r/10
if
 s==3 or s==6 or s==9
 print "given number is divisible by 3"
else if
 s<=9
 print " given number is not divisible by 3"
else
 assign p=s
 assign sum=0
while
 assign q=p%10
 assign sum = sum +q
 assign p=p/10
if
 sum==3 or sum==6 or sum==9
 print "given number is divisible by 3"
else
 print " given number is not divisible by 3"
